# Prime library
### A library containing prime number operations
  
  
A simple library with functions that perform standard prime calculation.  
PrimeLib includes two different functions for primality testing and a few  
that efficently genereates prime numbers.  
  
  
### Roadmap
The API of this library will be frozen and the version number adhere to 
standard semantic versioning  
  
The only accepted reson to modify the API is to handle issues that otherwise  
can't be resolved or to add additional functionality
